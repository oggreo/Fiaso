International students usually own multiple bank accounts across countries. Existing apps are over complexed and do not work well with international banks. There is no convenient solution for students who just want to check how much in total they have.

With Fiaso you can add your bank accounts easily, no matter national or international, and the total balance will be auto converted into the main currency you set depending on the day's exchange rate.
